This website is the homepage of [Computerization](https://github.com/Computerization) club, a high school student club in [Shanghai World Foreign Language Academy](http://www.wflms.cn).

It is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Developing & Testing

### Installation

```shell
$ yarn
```

This command installs all depedendencies specified by the [`yarn.lock`](/yarn.lock) file.

### Local Development

```shell
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. You can preview your changes instantly with the development server as you edit the files. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Other locales

```shell
$ yarn start --locale en
```

The default language for the website is simplified Chinese (`zh-Hans`). In order to view the English version locally, start the development server with the english locale. Note that each locale is an independent application, so you cannot use the language dropdown to switch between languages in development.

### Handling Static Assets

To save bandwidth & make loading faster, images will need to be optimized first. You can refer to Google's [PageSpeed Insights: Optimize Images](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/OptimizeImages). Alternatively, you can use the following command in Linux with [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) installed.

```shell
$ convert in.jpg -sampling-factor 4:2:0 -strip -quality 85 -interlace JPEG -colorspace sRGB out.jpg
```

## Building & Deploying

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

```
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> USE_SSH=1 yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

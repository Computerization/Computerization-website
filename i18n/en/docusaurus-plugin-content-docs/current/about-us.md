We are a refined CS community always working behind the scenes to provide community-oriented knowledge services.

### Our Name

**C 社 << Computerization << 世外信息化社** Our full name is the Computerization club, 世外信息化社; But we would prefer to be called Computerization (in Chinese, C 社), since it's more concise, plus it has the same name as the C Programming Language (\*Laugh\*) Our English name, though, is always Computerization.

### Our opinion on CS

For us, programming is not only a carrier of ideas, but also the logic and philosophy behind the code; It's the algorithms that define computer scientists, not the literal codes. **This is our Faith**, and also the reason why we call ourselves a **CS club** rather than a programming club.

Besides, this also leads to our community culture of conveying ideas about program designing.

### What does Compuetrization do?

Our main job is to **provide services to various clubs, communities and the student union**. For example, we wrote the [SAM platfrom](https://github.com/Computerization/SAM/), which had already undertaken the following tasks:

- Registration of "WFLA Cup"
- Scoring and statistical work of new club / five star club / bottom-out defense
- "2017 Why Charity" online auction
- Appointment of club activity classroom in 2018
- The display of WFLA CAS club list
- ...

### What else?

In addition to cooperating with various other clubs to complete projects, we also:

- Organize program designing sharing sessions
- Prepare for National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP)
- Learn discrete mathematics, linear algebra and other tools

In addition, we also carry out a series of courses, such as MATLAB and LaTeX, or Python and R.

### Why should you join us?

At Computerization, not only can you **Communicate with others to improve yourself**; but you will also get a platform for **self-expression**. For example, you can tell your classmates what you know about **computer principles** and **cybersecurity**. You can also post your own articles about technology on **Techomedia**, share your newly accumulated knowledge in the **Math club**, or contribute your own ideas to the **SAM platform**, and help out other clubs, communities and organizations;

**Here in Computerization, all difficulties can be overcomed through technology**

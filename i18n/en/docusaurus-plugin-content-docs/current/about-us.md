We are a refined CS community, which has been working behind the scenes for a long time to provide community-oriented knowledge services

### Our Name

**C 社 << Computerization << 世外信息化社**
Our full name is the Computerization club, 世外信息化社;
But we would prefer to be called C-club, since its short and clear, plus it has the same name as the C Programming Language（\*Laugh）

### Our opinion on CS

For us, programming not only is a carrier of ideas, but also the logic and thought behind the functions;
It's algorithms that made computer scientists who he/she is, not codes.
**This is our Faith**, also the reason why we called our selves a **CS club** but not a programming club.

Besides, this also leads to our community culture of conveying ideas about program designing.

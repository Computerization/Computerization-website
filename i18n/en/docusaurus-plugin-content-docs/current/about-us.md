We are a small and refined CS community, which has been working behind the scenes for a long time and mainly provides community-oriented knowledge services

### Our Name

**C 社 << Computerization << 世外信息化社**
Our full name is Computerization，世外信息化社；
But we would prefer to be called C-club，since its short and clear，plus it has the same name the C Programming Language（\*Laugh）

### Our opinion on CS

The program in our eyes is not only the code as a form carrier, but also the logic and thought behind it;
It's algorithms that make computer scientists, not the codes.
**This is our Faith**，its also the reason why we called our selves a **CS club** but not a programming club。

Besides, this also lead to our community culture of communications on program designing.

### What do we do?

Our main job is **Provide knowledge services to various clubs, communities and the student union**。
For example, we wrote the [SAM 平台](https://github.com/Computerization/SAM/)，he has already undertaken the following tasks on various occasions：

-Registration of "WFLA Cup"
-Scoring and statistical work of new clubs/five star clubs/last club defenses
-"2017 Why Charity" online auction
-Appointment of community activity classroom in year 2018
-The display of WFLA community list
-……

### What else?

In addition to cooperating with various other CAS groups to complete projects, we also:

-Organize program designing communications
-Prepare for National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP)
-Learning discrete mathematics, linear algebra and all other possible tools

In addition, we also carry out a series of courses and teaching, such as MATLAB, latex, or python, R

Enspire is a newly born project, aimed to provide a **technical support platform** for **the school's CAS activities**.

### Why Enspire?

Stay original :fire:

Computerization is a service club created in the hope of providing convenience to school life (which SAM demonstrated).

And now we discover that students have a bigger demand for management, technical, and advertising during CAS activities, compared with assignment uploads and classroom reservation.

The goal of Enspire is simple: **make CAS life easier for every one** (in WFLA, at least for now)

Of course, if the clubs can be inspired by Enspire, it would be even greater :P

### As a Computerization member, do I have to participate in development?

**Not necessarily**

If you think Enspire is **a valuable project**, and you are **willing to devote your time and effort**, then come!

Enspire is an **open-source project** of Computerization, but you can choose to not participate, to make very little contribution, or to work 24/7 :boom:

If you are not familiar with **open-source projects**, you can refer to this website: https://opensource.guide/.

If you want to take part, please read the https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/ section carefully.
It includes a lot of fundamental but essential information that every contributor needs to know.

### What functions will Enspire provide?

As aforementioned, the basic ideas are **club administration, technology, and advertising**. Proposed functions include:

- Blog posts and member contacts
- Search for clubs by labels
- "I am interested" and "I want to join"
- FAQ from other clubs for Computerization on technical issues
- School ranking of clubs?!
- ... (You are welcome to commit any other ideas :bulb:)

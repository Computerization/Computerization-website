We also undertake the "informationize" work of other clubs, for example, we once provided technological support for [THE Hack Maker Marathon](https://thehack.org.cn) held by the techomedia club，during which we were responsible for the preparation of various websites, such as the contestant registration platform、[Questioning platform](https://github.com/hackinit/helpq)、[Hardware reservation / tracking platform](https://github.com/hackinit/cog), etc.

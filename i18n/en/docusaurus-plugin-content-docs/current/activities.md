### Regular activities

In 2020, the three departments of Computerization have their own activity schedule.

- After school on Monday, the **AI** department in cooperation with Math club organizes AI and mathematical modeling courses;
- After school on Wednesday, the **algorithm Department** hosts discussions on NOIP, USACO exercise problems and some analysis of algorithms and data structures;
- At lunchtime on Wednesday and Thursday, the **web development team** learns about front-end development and back-end frameworks, and contribute to the club's [GitHub projects](https://github.com/Computerization).

### Other activities

We also undertake the informatization work of other clubs. For example, we once provided technological support for [THE Hack Hackathon](https://thehack.org.cn) hosted by Techomedia, during which we were responsible for the preparation of various websites, such as the contestant registration platform, [Questioning platform](https://github.com/hackinit/helpq), [Hardware reservation / tracking platform](https://github.com/hackinit/cog), etc.

Currently, we are in the early stage of development of [Enspire](enspire/what-is-enspire). We occasionally get some new demands from the student union or school teachers, after which we will develop intensively.

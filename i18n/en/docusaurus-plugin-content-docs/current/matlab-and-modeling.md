MATLAB is a part of the the **course series on mathematical modeling** carried out by Computerization and math club cooperatively.

### Why should you learn MATLAB?

Matlab is an advanced language for **scientific computing** and **engineering computing**.

When compared with other similar languages, MATLAB has the following advantages:

- Easier to be learned and used
- Ample native functions, especially matrix operations
- Powerful graphics processing enables easy creation of complex graphics
- Many functions are adaptive: they automatically select the optimal algorithm, avoid errors and improve efficiency

### What can you learn

After completing the studing on basics, you can program mathematical models through MATLAB to learn the usage of MATLAB in mathematical modeling.

Course syllabus:

1. MATLAB: Operator, program logic
2. Common function fitting
3. Linear programming
4. Statistical regression model
5. Probability model
6. Discrete model (analytic hierarchy process; AHP)
7. Basic LaTeX

### Supplementary course syllabus

We also offer the following contents for those who are interested:

1. Neural network, cluster analysis
2. Differential equation model
3. Advanced LaTeX

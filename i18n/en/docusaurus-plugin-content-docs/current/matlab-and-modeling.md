MATLAB is a part of the the **course series on mathematical modeling** carried out by C-club and math club cooperatively

### Why should you learn MATLAB?

Matlab is a senior language for **scientific computing** and **engineering computing**.

when compared with other similar languages, MATLAB has the following advantages:

- easier to be learned and used
- Has a wealth of native methods/functions, especially for those about matrix
- It is powerful on graphics processing and can easily draw complex graphics
- Many functions are adaptive, they automatically select the optimal algorithm, avoid errors and improve efficiency

### What can you learn

After completed the studing on basics, you can program mathematical models through MATLAB to learn the usage of MATLAB in mathematical modeling

Course syllabus:

1. MATLAB: Operator, program logic
2. Common function fitting
3. Linear programming
4. Statistical regression model
5. Probability model
6. Discrete model (analytic hierarchy process; AHP)
7. Basic LaTeX

### supplementary course syllabus

We also offer the following contents for the students who are interested:

1. Neural network, cluster analysis
2. Differential equation model
3. Advanced LaTeX
